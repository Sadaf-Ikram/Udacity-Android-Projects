### Android Basics Nanodegree Project 1: Build a Single Screen App

Design and implement a single screen app that displays information about a fictional small business. Think along the lines of your favorite
coffeeshop, local restaurant, or that gem of a store that sells those rare comic books or records.

My design of the app include:

● Business name

● one photo representing the business

● Two or more other pieces of information, such as:

 ○ Contact information for the business (phone number, email address)

 ○ Address of the Business

 ○ Description of business

 ○ Hours of operation
